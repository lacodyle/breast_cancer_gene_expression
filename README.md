# Breast Cancer Clinical and Gene Expression Data Analysis 
<i> Data Analysis Project for DSC424: Advanced Data Analysis at DePaul University </i><br>
<i>Highlights: Feature Dimensionality Reduction with PCA and Factor Analysis </i><br>

Analysis of breast cancer clincial features and gene expression features to explore their relationship using principal
component analysis (PCA), factor analysis, and cluster analysis. In this group project, my focus was on preprocessing of the data and performed 
dimensionality reduction of the gene expression features using PCA from 663 to 25. Principle factor analysis and common factor analysis were performed
to discover patterns in the gene expression features and lastly cluster analysis was also performed as an exploration. 

The dataset is acquired through the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) database through <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raghadalharbi/breast-cancer-gene-expression-profiles-metabric"> Kaggle. </a> The dataset contains 1,904 instances and 693 features with each instance representing a breast cancer patient, the patient's clinicial attributes, and their gene expression attributes.
